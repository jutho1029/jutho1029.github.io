During the first week I attended multiple python classes and I got to practice working with dictionaries in python. I was also introducted to aspects of machine learning. For the machine learing course, I used an algorithm to split the data and train a logisic regression model. Dr. Peng showed us how a few of the instruments in his chemistry lab works and showed us a greenhouse.
