In the second week, I switched projects to Develop a Machine Learning Model to detect Genetic Biomarkers and early prediction of Lung Cancer from Transcriptomic Datasets. This week I familiarized myself with the pandas and numpy python libraries. We practiced data cleaning techniques with some sample data, and searched for more data sources online. We also started to do the literature review which we are still working on.
